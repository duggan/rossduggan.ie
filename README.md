# rossduggan.ie

This is the HTML source of <http://rossduggan.ie> as crawled by [HTTrack](http://www.httrack.com/).

In its live form, this was a Wordpress blog.

Some redundant elements have been removed, but otherwise this is pretty much a straight crawl for archival purposes.

Posts, images, and internal links are generally preserved, though externally facing links have not.

The httrack command used to create this archive was:

```
$ httrack "http://rossduggan.ie/" -O . "+*.rossduggan.ie/*" -v
```

Simple enough!
