		<description><![CDATA[Oh yeah, the CloudFormation templates I created use the Amazon Linux AMI for each region, so this way the person who created the other AMIs doesn&#039;t need to worry about maintaining them, or paying for access to them. These are standard across regions, are free, and might work a slight bit better too!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I built 2 CloudFormation templates to allow you to easily spin up a ton of these things across multiple availability zones:

With a keypair ( so you can login to the host)
http://files.wordsaboutbytes.com/yahoo-messages-save.cf.txt
Without a keypair ( can&#039;t log in locally, but it will run)
http://files.wordsaboutbytes.com/yahoo-messages-save-nokeypair.cf.txt

1. Open the console 
2. Go to CloudFormation
3. Give your stack a name.
4. Select the file you downloaded from above
5. Click Next.
6. Fill in the parameters here ( # of instances, The nick you want to be tracked with at the archive team site, the spot price you are willing to pay, and optionally a keypair if you selected that file).
7. Check the box at the bottom acknowledging that the template will create IAM resources ( used by the host to bootstrap )
8. Click Continue.
9. Tags if you want, or click continue.
10. Review. Click Continue.
11. Close.

This will launch however many instances you told it to, as t1.micro&#039;s, as the spot price you set it to. When you want to stop, you just go and delete the stack in this console and everything should go away.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Not 100% sure on the individual cost as I&#039;m only monitoring aggregate bandwidth and not tracking when instances are killed or reappear, but I&#039;m running about 300 right now.

That&#039;s at about $0.003 per hour per instance, and only charged for outgoing bandwidth (about 10 GB for all so far). Ballpark figure is about $23 per day. It&#039;ll fluctuate up occasionally, but I&#039;ve set my payment limit to $0.005, so there&#039;s a roof.]]></description>
