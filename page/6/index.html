					<div class="entry-content">
<p>Towards the end of the working day on Friday, <a href="http://darraghdoyle.blogspot.com/">Darragh</a> casually mentioned that he was going to see &#8220;some guy called <a href="http://zefrank.com/">Ze Frank</a>&#8221; at the Science Gallery in Trinity that evening. Immediately I was asking to tag along, because Ze is probably one of the funniest people I have ever encountered, online or off. Like most good comedians, he also has a way of getting a message across when he wants to, though I&#8217;m not sure what he thinks of being considered a comedian. <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/18/business/fi-zefrank18">Well, at least I&#8217;m not saying it alone</a>.</p>
<p>Turns out Ze wasn&#8217;t the only person speaking, <span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jonah_Peretti">Jonah Peretti</a> was also speaking. I wasn&#8217;t familiar with the name, but he&#8217;s the guy behind <a href="http://blackpeopleloveus.com/">BlackPeopleLoveUs</a>, which I found quite hilarious in college <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Not necessarily a good reason to listen to him talk for an hour of course, but he also happens to be one of the founders of <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/">The Huffington Post</a> and <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/">BuzzFeed</a> and now his cred is apparent.</span></span></p>
<p><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">As one fellow attendee put it, Jonah was there to talk about the physical mechanics of the network by which viral media is dispersed, whereas Ze was there to talk about the media itself.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Jonah had some interesting stuff to say about &#8220;viral marketing&#8221; which he summarized as such:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Contagious Media<br />
</span></span></li>
<li><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Big Seed Marketing<br />
</span></span></li>
<li><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Mullet Strategy</span></span></li>
<li><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Fanatics</span></span></li>
<li><span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Mormonism</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p>To expand on the concepts a little as I understood them (<em>because I&#8217;m no journo and paraphrasing from memory doesn&#8217;t count as an explanation</em>):</p>
<h4>Contagious Media</h4>
<p>The idea of contagious media is that it&#8217;s stuff that will appeal to the &#8220;Bored At Work Network&#8221;, ie the large group of office workers who don&#8217;t necessarily enjoy their jobs, have free time and a fast Internet connection. I feel this is a pretty basic concept, but I can see why it might be overlooked. After all, how many people are really capable of looking beyond their own fascination with their creation to notice whether other people might actually enjoy it? Just because you like looking at pictures of your kid doesn&#8217;t mean anyone else necessarily will, <a href="http://omg.wthax.org/4e19613b79342e6cc6b1d8efc0a1e4b2.jpg">unless&#8230;</a></p>
<h4>Big Seed Marketing</h4>
<p>Big seed marketing sounds to me like dressed up spam, the idea being that you seed a very large audience with the idea being that a percentage of that large audience will pass along the message to a much smaller, but still significant (due to the large seed) secondary group.</p>
<h4>Mullet Strategy</h4>
<p>Keep your shiny, well presented content to the fore and your rough, unedited user generated content deeper in the site, &#8220;Business up front, party in the back&#8221;. This is the model the Huffington Post uses for presenting it&#8217;s data, and I think it has it&#8217;s uses. If you think about a user generated content reviews site, for example, you&#8217;d probably want to have some professional level articles seeded in there to draw users in in the first place. Some sites work well as pure user generated content, some don&#8217;t. Many novice webmasters are under the impression that simply by building something, or installing a piece of OOTB software, people will flock to it. This is another example of &#8220;my kids photo&#8221; mentality and it&#8217;s a prevalent one.</p>
<h4>Fanatics</h4>
<p>Peretti coins this as something like &#8220;people with personality disorders&#8221;, which I think is quite appropriate. One of his examples he used in the talk was Wikipedia, which singularly exploits the Obsessive Compulsive disorder. Edit, revert, tidy, cite, categorize. I vaguely recall a generic statistic on user generated content sites that the generators are something like 1% of the actual audience of the content. This sort of correlates with rough Boards.ie data, which last year put &#8220;active contributors&#8221; at a figure of about 16,000 per month, while our audience figures were something like 1.3 million.</p>
<h4>Mormonism</h4>
<p>Evangelists. People who love your stuff and will &#8220;sell it&#8221; to their friends and anyone they know. I thought a more Irish equivalent would be your average <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chugger">chugger</a> on the street, but I have a feeling Mormons don&#8217;t generate nearly the amount of animosity that charity muggers do. Mormons are persistent <em>overall</em>, but polite and generally inoffensive in my experience. More importantly, they slowly make conversions without, I believe, generating heavy negative collateral.</p>
<p>Ze&#8217;s segment of the talk was largely focused on the surprising unpredictability what is and isn&#8217;t popular. He spoke about connecting to people on a very personal level, and put emphasis on how he doesn&#8217;t set out to make money on any of his forays into social media. He&#8217;s just trying to have fun and try new ways of interacting with people and having them interact with each other using the Internet.</p>
<p>Some of the most successful experiments by Ze appear to possess the commons traits of having a low barrier to entry (almost anyone can try it) and requiring minimal effort or expenditure of time. But they also allow for the &#8220;fanatics&#8221; to really push the boundaries and explore the limits of the idea. Some examples of these are &#8220;YoungMeNowMe&#8221;, the &#8220;Ray &#8211; Whip Ass&#8221; remixes and &#8220;Earth Sandwich&#8221;.</p>
<p>Overall, I was very happy that I was able to attend this talk, I also met a few interesting people at the gathering in the Science Gallery café after the talk, like <a href="http://twitter.com/cianmm">@cianmm</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/patrickod">@patrickod</a>. Unfortunately I missed out on the flashmob experiment at the Stag&#8217;s Head on Saturday (I would have been a circle), probably missed my only opportunity to get a photo with Ze too, which is disappointing. Ah well.</p>

<p>This is going to be the first in a series of posts &#8220;documenting&#8221; (I use the term loosely) largely unknown or unused features of Boards.ie, stuff that you don&#8217;t generally find in your bog standard vBulletin install. I may occasionally post something of community significance, but my primary goal is to inform interested techies <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>The first Tydka-Bie is about the long forgotten <a href="http://www.foaf-project.org/"><em>FOAF</em></a> functionality that <a href="http://johnbreslin.com/">Daddy-Cloud</a> put into the system many moons ago. Incidentally, this particular entry is inspired by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111029095317/http://blog.echolibre.com/2009/03/practical-json-format-standard/">a post from </a><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111029095317/http://blog.echolibre.com/2009/04/practical-json-format-standard/">David over on the echolibre blog</a>.</p>
<p>The FOAF data is exposed via the URL:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><code>http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/foaf.php?u=$id</code></p>
<p>So, for example, to retrieve the FOAF data for my personal boards.ie account, you would access <a href="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/foaf.php?u=2563">http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/foaf.php?u=2563</a></p>
<p>This will give you a nice, simple listing of some of my profile data and the people in my friends list (<strong>Update: </strong><em>nice as far as a programmer is concerned, this is an unformatted XML list</em>). This was introduced several years ago, and forgotten about several years ago, so there is likely new, useful data which could be incorporated using the rdf:foaf ontology, as well as some information that is maybe outdated. I&#8217;m open to suggestions for updating/expanding the use for this.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re interested in using FOAF, you may also find <a href="http://sioc-project.org/">SIOC</a> interesting, the development of which has been spearheaded by Boards.ie&#8217;s own John Breslin, and is essentially an effort to make user &#8220;social web&#8221; information more portable around the Internet, to open up the data. I did some brief work with the SIOC team on prototyping a plugin for vBulletin in early 2008 which doesn&#8217;t appear to have made it to the <a href="http://sioc-project.org/applications">applications section</a>, so I may look into it again myself.</p>

					<div class="entry-content">
<p>Well this was I spent a good portion of of my working day doing on March 31st.</p>
<p>About two weeks ago, the supermoderators, administrators and employees of Boards.ie starting asking what we should do for April Fool&#8217;s day. I had been poking around on <a href="http://vbulletin.org/">vBulletin.org</a> earlier and had come across <a href="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=184016">a Facebook style skin</a>, so my first suggestion was that we simply tell people we&#8217;d been bought by Facebook and throw the skin up on the site.</p>
<p>Well everyone else took that idea and ran with it, making for an interesting &#8211; if somewhat unbelievable <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> &#8211; April Fool&#8217;s prank, <a href="http://www.faceboards.ie/">www.faceboards.ie</a>. Made for an interesting morning for everyone, and as it didn&#8217;t disrupt boards.ie itself I think it was pulled off without irritating anyone.</p>
<p>Various moderators and users really got into it, and the Supermoderators and <a href="http://www.containstracesofnut.com/">DeVore</a> dropped various &#8220;hints&#8221; throughout the week to try and aid the eventual reveal.</p>
<p>Technically it was a fairly simple trick to pull off; although I stopped at changing our domain cookies to make faceboards.ie a true &#8220;mirror&#8221; as I figured it would cause more disruption than was worth doing. It involved the use of the <a href="http://www.vbulletin.org/forum/showthread.php?t=174381">same basic hack</a> (and related) that I used to set up m.boards.ie, and just making sure the front page and other pages did the same style switching when the domain &#8220;face.boards.ie&#8221; was requested.<br />
The majority of my time was spent fixing bugs in the style, adding functionality for some modifications, fiddling with some graphics and layout, and generally just shining it up enough so that people didn&#8217;t immediately see the ruse.</p>
<p>Altogether it was good fun, probably didn&#8217;t trick many people but at least everyone had a bit of a laugh.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2009/03/21/FacebookStreamRedesignDisruptiveCompaniesDontListenToTheirCustomersMarkZuckerburg.aspx">A better written article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2009/03/21/why-facebook-has-never-listened-and-why-it-definitely-wont-start-now/">Alternate POV</a>.</p>
<p>Probably common knowledge at this stage, but Facebook has made a definite move towards taking over the &#8220;microblogosphere&#8221; of Twitter with the recent update to their newsfeed feature.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never directly compared Twitter to the Facebook newsfeed, because I don&#8217;t see their usage as overlapping. Twitter, for me, is for communicating with people who share the same interests as me, &#8220;networking&#8221; as it were, whereas Facebook is more of a noticeboard for all the people I&#8217;ve known from school, work, as well as friends and family.<br />
If the distinction between the people I converse with on Twitter and the people I converse with on Facebook began to become hazy, then chances are I&#8217;d just end up drifting to the better platform.</p>
<p>Which brings me to comparisons.</p>
<h3>Interesting differences</h3>
<p><strong>Facebook has threaded conversations</strong> &#8211; This is something that people have been <a href="http://sixrevisions.com/web_design/10-features-that-will-make-twitter-better/">asking for</a> on Twitter for a while now. To be fair to Twitter, when you&#8217;ve got something that&#8217;s obviously popular, you&#8217;re reluctant to tamper with it too much (especially when you didn&#8217;t really realize what you were creating in the first place).</p>
<p><strong>Facebook has grouping</strong> &#8211; Also something people have been asking for for some time (same list as above).</p>
<p><strong>Facebook has embedded objects</strong> &#8211; Like video. This is an attractive use, but I&#8217;m not sure how portable a concept it is. I can&#8217;t see video on my low-tech phone, and even if it was high tech, the data fees in Ireland are astronomical.</p>
<p>In fact, Facebook appears to have picked up on some of the weaknesses of Twitter and tried to improve, but somehow &#8211; if you&#8217;ll allow the pun &#8211; have managed to <em>completely rearrange their own face</em> in the process. I don&#8217;t particularly want Facebook to be a replacement for Twitter, it has too much personal / irrelevant information, and I don&#8217;t want to micromanage who does and doesn&#8217;t see that information anymore than I already have to.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really care to bombard people on Twitter with photos of events / parties that just have no bearing to them. I like wandering through friends/family photos on Facebook, but if I was being bombarded with party photos from the CTO of xyz on Twitter I&#8217;d be unfollowing and would expect the same if the situation were reversed. I want information from Twitter and some updates that are perfectly ok to share with strangers / acquantiances that allow you a casual insight into their mindset. I don&#8217;t expect them to care any more about my family photos than I care about theirs, and it would be insulting and disingenuous to pretend otherwise.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s many subtle differences that seperate the two. In any case, I don&#8217;t see myself warming to the Facebook newsfeed option in the near future.</p>

<p>What is up with Google search engine results for the last few months?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t be the only person who uses Google like this. If I&#8217;m looking for a URL for something I&#8217;m referencing in a blog post, or on Boards.ie, or on Twitter, I&#8217;ll run a quick Google search (knowing I&#8217;ll find the correctl URL within the first couple of results) and then copy the link straight from the search page.</p>
<p>Only for some reason, as of some time last year, these previously nice and clean URLs are now full of Google-garbage. Hashcodes and redirects as though I were clicking on some obnoxious clicktracking advertisment. Surely there&#8217;s a less intrusive way to track your traffic, Google? I find myself visiting the website in question and copying the result from the address bar now, which is cutting precious seconds away from my perfectly timed razor sharp Internet humour, occasionally even stealing moments of glory from me.</p>
<p>It irritates me.</p>
<p>It especially irritates me because I don&#8217;t actually know how to search for the problem. If one searches for any combination of &#8220;google&#8221;, &#8220;links&#8221; and &#8220;problem&#8221; or similar, all it pulls up is information about malware. It also irritates me because the link is fine on hover, but changes on right-click. Surely that in itself is bad UI practice?</p>
<p>Maybe this is a more common problem with a more common solution than I&#8217;m aware of, so any comments are welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Update: 2012-03-05</strong> Someone kindly dropped me a mail letting me know that A&amp;W root beer is stocked at a Spar near the Vicar Street venue.</p>
<p><strong>Update: 2011-06-13</strong> <a href="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2056295197">According to Bargain Alerts</a>, Amazon will soon start shipping groceries to Ireland, in which case you&#8217;ll be able to buy <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/search/ref=as_li_qf_sp_sr_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=Root%20beer&amp;tag=duggan-21&amp;index=aps&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738">A&amp;W Root Beer</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="https://www.assoc-amazon.co.uk/e/ir?t=duggan-21&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=2" alt="" width="1" height="1" border="0" /> from them! Woo!</p>
<p><strong>Update: 2011-01-13</strong> Yankee Soda seem to have stopped stocking A&amp;W root beer unfortunately; they now stock &#8220;<a href="http://www.yankeesoda.co.uk/collections/soda/products/dads-root-beer">DAD&#8217;S</a>&#8221; root beer, but I have no idea what that tastes like. The search continues <img src="../../wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> Apparently <a href="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=2055479443">it is infrequently stocked in Fallon &amp; Byrne on Exchequer Street in Dublin at €1.55 a can</a>. Although F&amp;B recently went into administration, so may not be there for long.</p>
<p>Bit outside the planned scope of this blog early on, but it&#8217;s worth a mention. There are <a href="http://www.boards.ie/vbulletin/showthread.php?t=31091">plenty of places</a> <a href="http://www.tommcmahon.net/2004/01/aw_root_beer_no.html">where people</a> <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070522073640AA0RC1O">are asking</a> <a href="http://chowhound.chow.com/topics/564341">about this</a>.</p>
<p>No proper answers that I can see, at least, some awful chinese root beer from an oriental supermarket does not count as root beer. When I say root beer, I mean none other than <a href="http://www.rootbeer.com/">A&amp;W Root Beer</a>, purveyors of deliciousness. I became mildly addicted to this stuff on my first trip to the United States in 2002. I became permanently hooked on my second visit in 2007 and subsequent minor trip.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bit of a love it or hate it taste, if you haven&#8217;t tried it and liked it, it&#8217;s probably not worth the gamble, but if you like this stuff and can&#8217;t find it anywhere, I&#8217;ve found a reliable and relatively inexpensive retailer!</p>
<p><a href="http://yankeesoda.co.uk/">Yankee Soda</a>, although probably one of the less &#8220;graceful&#8221; user experiences out there, has a pretty attractive price at <strong>£16.95 for 24 cans</strong>, with £5.50 delivery to the Republic of Ireland. I wouldn&#8217;t trust that site with my credit card, but fortunately they offer PayPal as an option. Turnaround time for<strong> delivery was an unbelievable two days,</strong> delivered to my workplace by courier.</p>
<p>So, if you&#8217;ve been looking for Root Beer but haven&#8217;t been able to get any satisfaction, try these guys, I&#8217;m ordering my second batch now as I&#8217;ve made short work of my first crate in just over a week.</p>

<p>I watched a video today by Tom Raftery via his <a href="http://greenmonk.net/">GreenMonk blog/ustream show</a>, in which he was talking about the ramifications of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_grid">smart grid</a> technology. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve heard of this stuff before considering it&#8217;s been in development for a while, but consciously this is new to me.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, as I understand it, &#8220;smart grid&#8221; technology is a digital method of distributing electricity, allowing for advanced monitoring, even feedback and remote control, resulting in greater efficiency and reduced cost.</p>
<p>Clever stuff, sounds like a great, obvious helper in the fight to make the world more energy efficient. However, as Tom points out, due to the nature of the technology this means that the power company can tell what tech you&#8217;re running in your house. This sort of granular access, one might imagine, would be as powerful a force in advertising as Google, quite possibly even more so.</p>
<p>Imagine being able to profile households on the sort of electrical devices they use. How many televisions they have, what brands of televisions they use, when they have them on, etc, and being able to plot and compare this information across every household on the planet that uses electricty. The consequences of such a powerhouse (excuse the pun) put to the task of advertising are nothing short of staggering. The possibilities are virtually unlimited in a world that grows ever dependent on high technology.</p>
<p>You can read more about the emerging smart grid technologies in<a href="http://www.economist.com/science/displaystory.cfm?story_id=13253037&amp;fsrc=twitter"> this Economist article</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/TECH/03/20/smartgrid.vulnerability/">Smartgrid Vulnerability</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2:</strong> <a href="http://www.google.org/powermeter/smarterpower.html">Looks like Google are already on top of this one, clever people, them.</a></p>

					<div class="entry-content">
<h3>Backstory</h3>
<p>I came across this book via a visit (possibly my first) to <a href="http://boingboing.net/">BoingBoing</a>, which is apparently <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a>&#8216;s dumping ground for stuff, which I visited as a result of a recent episode of <a href="http://twit.tv/">This Week in Tech</a> that featured Cory as a guest.</p>
<p>I was sold on it by the promise of a post-aplocalyptic tale, a subgenre of science fiction that has never failed to enrapture me, from Larry Niven&#8217;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucifer%27s_Hammer">Lucifer&#8217;s Hammer</a></em> (which is really more &#8220;apocalyptic&#8221;), to Cormac McCarthy&#8217;s <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Road">The Road</a></em> and even <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Max">Mad Max</a></em>, I&#8217;ve always been a sucker for a good disaster tale, the upheaval of society, an essay on how people might survive in unbelievable scenarios.</p>
<h3>The Author</h3>
<p>The author, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Sterling">Bruce Sterling</a>, is someone who I&#8217;m surprised not to have come across since I read extensively and almost exclusively in the broader SF genre. According to Wikipedia he has played a major role in the evolution of the cyberpunk subgenre, which may account for my lack of familiarity, since I have somehow managed to entirely avoid this genre in literature despite being intimately familiar with most films and anime in it.</p>
<h3>First Impression</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve read only the first twentysomething pages of this novel, but it has a strong ecological element, which I&#8217;m hoping doesn&#8217;t become preachy, technobabble that reminds me of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neal_Stephenson">Neal Stephenson</a>, but without the frenetic pace or wit and an emerging plotline about cloning, which could prove interesting.<br />
Like most good novels that take a while to &#8220;get into&#8221;, this one is heavily invested in its own terminology, which I&#8217;ve always thought is an ambitious undertaking by a writer since it&#8217;s difficult to strike a balance where you draw the reader in rather than alienate them entirely.<br />
According to his wikipedia entry, Sterling is quite fond of his neologisms, which undoubtedly accounts for the style of writing.</p>
<p>Thus far, the story appears as though it will be following the trials and tribulations of one Vera Mihajlovic &#8211; the first of several Slavic names that the reader encounters, in addition to the apparently northern European or perhaps Russian setting of the novel&#8217;s introduction.<br />
Vera is one of the titular caryatids; if you&#8217;re not terribly familiar with Greek architecture, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caryatid">a caryatid is a female sculpted support column</a>, the metaphor being explained in a brief synopsis of Vera&#8217;s origin early in the book.</p>
<p>Vera is one of the Acquis, a global civilization (Internet?) made up of the scattered remains of broken nations on a mission to recover the planet and one assumes save the human race from running itself into extinction (<a href="http://www.tomrafteryit.net/">Tom Raftery</a>?). They&#8217;re developing state of the art technology and using distributed computing (if I said cloud computing would I get buzzword points?) to monitor the environment and plan and execute it&#8217;s recovery.</p>
<p>As the book contains no plot blurb, just praise from other authors and <a href="http://www.salon.com/">Salon</a> (wtf?), I have no idea if this book is going to take a twist or turn interesting in a way that someone without the lofty goals of the modern greeny technologist will appreciate; I can only wait and see how the story develops.</p>
<p>Will wait until I&#8217;m further into the book before forming a more solid opinion, but it has my interest piqued.</p>
