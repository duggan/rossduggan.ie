		<description><![CDATA[Try the drinks section of Fallon&amp;Byrnes or Donnybrook Fair. 
But sod root beer, it&#039;s too sickly sweet. What I want to find is a cheaper source for that most delectable of beverages, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bundaberg-brew.com.au/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Bundaberg Ginger Beer&lt;/a&gt;.
*sigh*
Problem is, you see, all the ginger drinks sold here are either sickly-sweet US Ginger Ale, or Fiery UK Ginger Beer. Bundaberg isn&#039;t too sweet and won&#039;t burn the mouth off you. I can find it in Donnybrook Fair allright, or order it in the Waterstones Cafe, but that&#039;s a bit expensive for a drink I want to order in pint glasses like I could in every pub in the UK :(]]></description>
