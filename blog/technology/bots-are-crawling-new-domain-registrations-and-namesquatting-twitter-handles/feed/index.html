		<description><![CDATA[I had a similar issue before, but I only checked if a domain was free, which it was, went to registered it a day or two later and it was registered the day after I checked !

I knew you can get &#039;recently registered&#039; lists from some registrars,  but Blacknight, have you been on to them ?

		<description><![CDATA[@Ross, i understand your concern. The handle i requested was released on terms of &quot;Inactivity&quot;, as the username was still inactive after 12 months. I dont think you can wait to reclaim the handle after few months(depends, if your beta launch is scheduled later) .

Can this scraping be reported to Twitter to act in the best intentions to avoid squatting ?
I feel that Domain registrars may have some contribution in it.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Shakir, glad you managed to find a resolution to your problem! 

I received a response from Twitter today and unfortunately, as I suspected, the namesquatting policy does not apply to my situation as far as Twitter are concerned.
