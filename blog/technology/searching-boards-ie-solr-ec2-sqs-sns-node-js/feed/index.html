		<description><![CDATA[Hi Alex, thanks!

You&#039;re right in that it&#039;s tricky to compare the two, but I&#039;ll see if I can dig up some numbers either for the next post or as an update to this one.

The ranking is based on a mixture of post time, how prominent the search terms are (spread out in the body or tightly coupled in the title), number of responses, &quot;thanks&quot; and views. It&#039;s not actually a particularly complicated blend but seems to turn up pretty reliable results. Plans are to tweak it occasionally, attempt to add more information to the scoring, etc.

There&#039;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SolrRelevancyFAQ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;a pretty comprehensive FAQ on the Solr wiki&lt;/a&gt;; it was close to hieroglyphics the first time I read it but makes a lot more sense now. I&#039;d like to give a quick run through in a future post.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A super article.  Well done.  What would be really interesting is to hear some performance metrics.  For example, searching X number of records in MySQL takes this whereas using Solr it takes this.   I appreciate it may not really be apples with apples as I assume both are running on different spec hardware.   Also what would also be really interesting would to be hear some info on the algorithm you&#039;re using to determine what&#039;s the best hit, second best hit, third best hit.  I presume it&#039;s a mixture of time and number of times key phrases match.

Very good stuff though. Well done.]]></description>
