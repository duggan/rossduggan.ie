		<description><![CDATA[Solid post, I find it ironic that Waters&#039; article seemed so contemptuous of the back and forth relationship that web-based writing/reporting often involves in a medium that is fundamentally devoid of that kind of feedback. I know I&#039;m not adding a tremendous amount to the debate here, but the whole thing rubbed me the wrong way in a, &quot;Look how good I am, are you not impressed by the fact that this text has been printed? it is on paper... that makes me better than you,&quot; kind of fashion.

Again, might just be me, but I felt a little riled by the whole debate. Of course, not having a medium in which to respond, I did what comes naturally... I forgot about it and got on with my life. 

I think it might be better to engage a bit more with a readership.]]></description>
